Where time is the currency. How it works? There are two parties in a trade 1) Person buying goods/services pays the seller his time, in other words the buyer has to either has to work for certain hours for seller if he wants something from seller or he can pay other people's time that is in his wallet that has similar or higher PersonQuality-rating than him(buyer).Everything (all the transactions records) are maintained in a crypto bockchain, also the TAC(Time As Currency) wallet. For example if you want to buy groceries in a store you have to work for the defined time in that store or have to arrange someone that can work for that much time and has PersonQuality-rating same as you or better than yours. What is PersonQuality-rating? : It is rating given to buyer and seller to one-another and revealed only after both of them submit their ratings.\\nNLP model to generate code to do anything and everything.

Here is an example of how you might use Python to implement a job platform that allows users to pay in the form of time instead of money:First, you will need to set up a blockchain to store the transactions that take place on your platform. You could use a popular blockchain platform such as Ethereum, or you could build your own blockchain using a library such as PyCrypto or PyBlock.Once you have your blockchain set up, you can start building the core functionality of your job platform. One way to do this might be to create a web application using a framework such as Django or Flask, which allows users to create profiles, post job listings, and apply for jobs.To implement the \\\"time as currency\\\" aspect of your platform, you could use a smart contract on your blockchain to track the amount of time that each user has available to pay for goods and services. You could then create a function that allows users to transfer their time to other users in exchange for goods or services.Here is an example of how you might implement this function using Python:Copy codedef transfer_time(from_user, to_user, amount):\\n  # Check that the from_user has enough time to transfer\\n  if from_user.time < amount:\\n    raise ValueError(\\\"Insufficient time available\\\")\\n\\n  # Deduct the transferred time from the from_user's balance\\n  from_user.time -= amount\\n\\n  # Add the transferred time to the to_user's balance\\n  to_user.time += amount\\n\\n  # Record the transaction on the blockchain\\n  blockchain.add_transaction(from_user, to_user, amount)\\nThis function will allow users to transfer a specified amount of time from their account to another user's account, as long as they have sufficient time available. It also records the transaction on the blockchain to ensure that it is transparent and immutable.You will also need to implement other functions and features to support the functionality of your job platform, such as posting and applying for jobs, rating and reviewing users, and managing user accounts and profiles. You could use a combination of Python and HTML/CSS/JavaScript to build a user-friendly web interface for your platform.\"\n    }\n]"
