The model may not be as accurate as a model trained from scratch on the larger dataset, but it can still be effective in labeling a significant portion of the data.Active Learning: You can use an initial model to label a portion of the data, then use the model's uncertain predictions to identify examples for manual annotation. This process can be iterated until the model reaches an acceptable level of performance.Semi-Automatic Annotation tools: Tools like Labelbox, Rectlabel, etc. are helpful in this case, this will allow you to automatically label a portion of your data, then review and correct any errors before moving on to the next batch.Generative Pre-training: Generative pre-training models like GPT-2 , BERT can also be fine-tuned for text classification tasks and can give you an approximate class labels for each text, so you can use them for labelling the unlabelled dataset.It's important to note that depending on the nature of your data, the task, and your budget, one approach may be more suitable than the others.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"message\": \"```\\n\\nY\\n\\n\\n# In[ ]:\\n\\n\\ny_pred[:,0] < y_pred[:,1]\\n\\n\\n# In[ ]:\\n\\n\\npredicted_labels = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)\\npredicted_labels\\n\\n\\n# In[ ]:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# In[ ]:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# In[ ]:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# In[ ]:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# #

Here are a few options:One way to automate data labeling is to use machine learning to predict labels for your data. You could train a model on a labeled dataset, and then use it to predict labels for your new dataset. This approach can work well if you have a large labeled dataset that is similar to your new dataset. However, it can be difficult to train a model that generalizes well to new data, so you may need to fine-tune the model using a small labeled sample of your new dataset.Another approach is to use active learning. This is a technique where you train a model on a small labeled dataset, and then use it to predict labels for a larger unlabeled dataset. The model is then used to identify the instances that are most uncertain or difficult to predict, and you have them labeled by human annotators. This approach can be more efficient than having human annotators label the entire dataset, as it focuses on the examples that are most informative for the model.You can also use pre-trained models like BERT or GPT-3 which are pre-trained on large amount of data and then fine-tuned for your dataset.

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is commonly used in web development, Express.js is a web framework for Node.js, React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Node.js is a JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.Another popular tech stack is the MEAN stack, which is similar to the MERN stack but uses Angular.js instead of React.js.For User authentication, you can use passport.js or jsonwebtoken package which is widely used in Node.js based web application. These authentication libraries provide easy to use and well tested modules that take care of the authentication process.For User profile web page, you can use libraries such as Material-UI, Bootstrap, Foundation and Bulma which provide pre-built UI components and responsive grid systems.It is important to note that the choice of tech stack depends on the specific requirements of your application and the skill-set of your development team. You should carefully evaluate the different options and choose the one that best suits your needs.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"message\": \"Neural Magic's sparse library is designed to take advantage of the unique characteristics of CPUs to perform machine learning operations more efficiently than traditional libraries that rely on GPU acceleration.

The ProfilePage component retrieves the user data from local storage and displays the user's name and email.You can use this code as a starting point, but keep in mind that it doesn't handle things like form validation, error messages, or user authentication. It's also worth noting that storing user data in local storage is not secure and should not be used in production. In a real-world scenario, you would use a secure way of storing and validating user data such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and a server-side authentication.Also, this is a basic setup, if you are planning to use in production, you would need to consider many other factors like security, scalability, maintainability and much more.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"message\": \"I want to create a webpage for users to login and copy-trade using our suggested trades using jugaad_trader library for trading on zerodha using api access. where users can submit their zerodha account access details and they can turn on and off following us on the trades.
