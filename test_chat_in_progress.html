In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of whole wheat flour and a pinch of salt. Mix well.\n  2. Slowly add water to the flour mixture, stirring to form a soft dough. You may not need to use all the water, so add it gradually until the dough comes together and is not too sticky.\n  3. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it is smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.\n  4. Divide the dough into 8-10 equal-sized balls. On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out each ball into a thin, circular shape.\n  5. Heat a dry, flat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. When the griddle is hot, carefully place a chapati on it and cook for about 30 seconds, or until bubbles start to form on the surface.\n  6. Flip the chapati and cook for another 30 seconds, or until it starts to brown and puff up. Brush with a little oil or ghee, if desired, and cook for another 30 seconds on each side, or until the chapati is evenly browned and cooked through.\n  7. Repeat with the remaining dough balls, stacking the cooked chapatis on a plate and covering them with a cloth to keep them warm. Serve the chapati roti hot, with your favorite accompaniments.\n\nNote: This recipe can be easily adapted to make larger or smaller chapatis, depending on your preference. You can also add other ingredients to the dough, such as cumin seeds or chopped herbs, for added flavor.

When a user navigates to the `/` route (e.g. `http://localhost:5000/`), the `index` function will be called, which will render the `index.html` template. This template should contain a form that allows the user to enter their API key and secret, as well as select the platform they want to view profiles from. When the form is submitted, the `profiles` function will be called, which will use the `FreelancePlatformAPI` class to retrieve the profile data from the selected platform and pass it to the `profiles.html` template to be displayed.\n\nTo make the web page more dynamic and interactive, you can use JavaScript and other web technologies to update the page without needing to refresh the page. For example, you could use JavaScript to make an AJAX request to the `/profiles` route and update the page with the new profile data without reloading the page.\n\nI hope this helps!

These platforms allow you to create a repository for your project, where you can version control your code and make it available to other users. You can also use features like Issues and Pull Requests to collaborate with other developers and manage contributions to the project.\n\n2. You can also use a licensing tool like the Open Source License Generator (https://opensource.org/licenses/generator) to create an open-source license for your project. This will allow you to specify the terms under which others can use and modify your code. There are several different types of open-source licenses to choose from, so you can pick one that aligns with your goals for the project.\n\n3. Another option is to use an open-source project hosting platform like SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net) or Google Code (https://code.google.com). These platforms are specifically designed for hosting open-source projects and often include additional features like bug tracking and project management tools.\n\nRegardless of which option you choose, it's important to carefully consider the terms under which you want to share your code and make sure you follow any relevant legal or ethical guidelines.\n\nI hope this helps!

Creating a chatbot that can answer every question is a very ambitious task, but it is possible to create a chatbot that can handle a wide range of topics and questions using a technique called \"information retrieval.\" This involves using a large database of pre-written answers and selecting the most relevant one for a given input. Here's some pseudocode for how this process could work:\n\n1. First, you will need to gather a large dataset of possible questions and answers. This could be done by manually creating a list of questions and answers, or by scraping websites for frequently asked questions and answers.\n\n2. Preprocess the data by tokenizing the questions and answers and removing stop words. You may also want to stem the words to reduce them to their base form (e.g., \"running\" becomes \"run\").\n\n3. Create a function that takes in a question and returns the most relevant answer. This can be done using a technique called \"tf-idf\" (term frequency-inverse document frequency). This involves calculating the importance of each word in the question and the answer and returning the answer with the highest tf-idf score.\n\n4. Test the chatbot by giving it a variety of questions and seeing if it returns the correct answer. You may need to tweak the parameters of the tf-idf function or add more data to the dataset to improve its performance.\n\nI hope this gives you a good starting point for creating your chatbot!
