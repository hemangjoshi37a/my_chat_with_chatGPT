You may not need to use all the water, so add it gradually until the dough comes together and is not too sticky.Knead the dough for a few minutes until it is smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.Divide the dough into 8-10 equal-sized balls. On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out each ball into a thin, circular shape.Heat a dry, flat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. When the griddle is hot, carefully place a chapati on it and cook for about 30 seconds, or until bubbles start to form on the surface.Flip the chapati and cook for another 30 seconds, or until it starts to brown and puff up. Brush with a little oil or ghee, if desired, and cook for another 30 seconds on each side, or until the chapati is evenly browned and cooked through.Repeat with the remaining dough balls, stacking the cooked chapatis on a plate and covering them with a cloth to keep them warm. Serve the chapati roti hot, with your favorite accompaniments.Note: This recipe can be easily adapted to make larger or smaller chapatis, depending on your preference.

Mix well.Slowly add water to the flour mixture, stirring to form a soft dough. You may not need to use all the water, so add it gradually until the dough comes together and is not too sticky.Knead the dough for a few minutes until it is smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.Divide the dough into 8-10 equal-sized balls. On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out each ball into a thin, circular shape.Heat a dry, flat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. When the griddle is hot, carefully place a chapati on it and cook for about 30 seconds, or until bubbles start to form on the surface.Flip the chapati and cook for another 30 seconds, or until it starts to brown and puff up. Brush with a little oil or ghee, if desired, and cook for another 30 seconds on each side, or until the chapati is evenly browned and cooked through.Repeat with the remaining dough balls, stacking the cooked chapatis on a plate and covering them with a cloth to keep them warm. Serve the chapati roti hot, with your favorite accompaniments.Note: This recipe can be easily adapted to make larger or smaller chapatis, depending on your preference. You can also add other ingredients to the dough, such as cumin seeds or chopped herbs, for added flavor.

These platforms allow you to create a repository for your project, where you can version control your code and make it available to other users. You can also use features like Issues and Pull Requests to collaborate with other developers and manage contributions to the project.You can also use a licensing tool like the Open Source License Generator (https://opensource.org/licenses/generator) to create an open-source license for your project. This will allow you to specify the terms under which others can use and modify your code. There are several different types of open-source licenses to choose from, so you can pick one that aligns with your goals for the project.Another option is to use an open-source project hosting platform like SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net) or Google Code (https://code.google.com). These platforms are specifically designed for hosting open-source projects and often include additional features like bug tracking and project management tools.Regardless of which option you choose, it's important to carefully consider the terms under which you want to share your code and make sure you follow any relevant legal or ethical guidelines.I hope this helps!
