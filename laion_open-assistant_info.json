How do I contribute?](CONTRIBUTING.md)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What is Open Assistant?\\n\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n    Open Assistant is a project meant to give everyone access to a great chat based large language model.\\n</p>\\n\\nWe believe that by doing this we will create a revolution in innovation in\\nlanguage. In the same way that stable-diffusion helped the world make art and\\nimages in new ways we hope Open Assistant can help improve the world by\\nimproving language itself.\\n\\n## Do you want to try it out?\\n\\nIf you are interested in taking a look at the current state of the project, you\\ncan set up an entire stack needed to run **Open-Assistant**, including the\\nwebsite, backend, and associated dependent services.\\n\\n##### To start the demo, run this in the root directory of the repository:\\n\\n```sh\\ndocker compose up --build\\n```\\n\\nThen, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (It may take some time to boot up) and\\ninteract with the website.\\n\\n> **Note:** When logging in via email, navigate to `http://localhost:1080` to\\n> get the magic email login link.\\n\\n> **Note:** If you would like to run this in a standardized development\\n> environment (a\\n> [\\\"devcontainer\\\"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers))\\n> using\\n> [vscode locally](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container#_create-a-devcontainerjson-file)\\n> or in a web browser using\\n> [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), you can use the\\n> provided [`.devcontainer`](.devcontainer/) folder.\\n\\n## The Plan\\n\\n##### We want to get to an initial MVP as fast as possible, by following the 3-steps outlined in the InstructGPT paper.\\n\\n1. Collect high-quality human generated Instruction-Fulfillment samples\\n   (prompt + response), goal >50k. We design a crowdsourced process to collect\\n   and reviewed prompts. We do not want to train on\\n   flooding/toxic/spam/junk/personal information data. We will have a\\n   leaderboard to motivate the community that shows progress and the most active\\n   users. Swag will be given to the top-contributors.\\n2. For each of the collected prompts we will sample multiple completions.\\n   Completions of one prompt will then be shown randomly to users to rank them\\n   from best to worst. Again this should happen crowd-sourced, e.g. we need to\\n   deal with unreliable potentially malicious users. At least multiple votes by\\n   independent users have to be collected to measure the overall agreement. The\\n   gathered ranking-data will be used to train a reward model.\\n3. Now follows the RLHF training phase based on the prompts and the reward\\n   model.\\n\\nWe can then take the resulting model and continue with completion sampling step\\n2 for a next iteration.\\n\\n## The Vision\\n\\nWe are not going to stop at replicating ChatGPT. We want to build the assistant\\nof the future, able to not only write email and cover letters, but do meaningful\\nwork, use APIs, dynamically research information, and much more, with the\\nability to be personalized and extended by anyone. And we want to do this in a\\nway that is open and accessible, which means we must not only build a great\\nassistant, but also make it small and efficient enough to run on consumer\\nhardware.\\n\\n### Slide Decks\\n\\n[Vision & Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n7IrAOVOqwdYgiYrXc8Sj0He8krn5MVZO_iLkCjTtu0/edit?usp=sharing)\\n\\n[Important Data Structures](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iaX_nxasVWlvPiSNs0cllR9L_1neZq0RJxd6MFEalUY/edit?usp=sharing)\\n\\n## How can you help?\\n\\nAll open source projects begin with people like you.

IMO it's easier to develop with because it's actually typesafe (unlike discord.py).

Sure, if you want to rewrite the bot using hikari that would be very helpful.\\n\\nThe main challenge for the bot is IMO beside the framework/impl details more the overall communication/workflow of the human feedback tasks. You almost certainly have a better overview than we over the bot-landscape and you may know what works and and what not. Could you ping me on the LAION discord server?\\n\\n@andreaskoepf\\nCollaborator\\nandreaskoepf commented 2 weeks ago\\n[will be copied for further discussion/planning to notion]\\n\\n@AlexanderHOtt You probably already read the high level protocol documentation. In general a frontend (like the bot) can request a task at the backend. If a task of the requested type is available the backend sends it back for the human to provide input on/feedback for it. Depending on the task different interactions are necessary. A human feedback task can potentially consist of multiple steps.\\n\\nCurrently the following tasks are defined (neither complete nor final set):\\n\\nsummarize_story\\nrate_summary\\ninitial_prompt\\nuser_reply\\nassistant_reply\\nrank_initial_prompts\\nrank_user_replies\\nrank_assistant_replies\\nOn of the critical decisions to make is how the users interact with the bot. Yannic was advocating for a group-interaction inside a channel that allows everyone to see posts of the other users (and potentially also interacting with them with emoji-reactions). Since different users will work at their own pace multiple tasks probably will have to be active at a given time and users should be able to request dedicated sessions. After prototyping some things I came up with the current structure of thread-based task-processing and self-destructing messages. Other earlier ideas looked much more cluttered and hard to follow. Different/better interaction concepts are up for debate.\\n\\nSome requirements for MVP are:\\n\\na minimal registration process with acceptance of terms of use for first-time users (e.g. privacy policy)\\nconfiguration which languages the user is able to speak, or alternatively a way to switch to/select a single language for all subsequent feedback tasks that are presented to the user\\na tutorial with some examples that explains how the human feedback process works and which commands and options are available; giving some guidelines how good input for the bot looks like and what to flag/report when the user sees it\\ntemplate based fully customizable bot task messages\\nsupport of tasks for the whole group inside a channel (probably task specific ui), discussion with @yk\\nsupport of dedicated sessions requested by a user (e.g. either only for the user in the channel or via DM, user can specify type of task to work on)\\ndisplay of leader board and important news in the bot channel\\ngiving users a way to provide feedback to other user's messages and task-input messages (e.g. conversation-fragments) via reactions\\nAdditional things:\\n\\nit is not clear how a group could work collaboratively on multi-step tasks, we could restrict group-tasks to single-step only [frontend would need a way to signal this to the backend]\\nin dedicated user sessions: a way for the user to reject/skip a task (e.g. if the user doesn't have the required expertise)\\nmoderation commands: moderators must be able to disable submissions of malicious users and to prevent content that has been authored by them from being shown to others (e.g. manual exclusion) [requires backend protocol extensions]\\ngive feedback to users in a timely manner about the ranking of their submissions (gamification) - [requires backend protocol extensions]\\n@andreaskoepf\\nCollaborator\\nandreaskoepf commented 2 weeks ago\\n@AlexanderHOtt You can see the current bot running in the test-discord here: https://discord.gg/DttpNT4p\\n\\n@AlexanderHOtt AlexanderHOtt mentioned this issue 5 days ago\\nDiscord bot issue list #231\\n Open\\n14 tasks```\",\n        \"response\": \"This is a Python module that defines a ApiClient class which extends the SQLModel class and specifies the columns of an api_client database table.The ApiClient class has several class attributes which correspond to columns in the database table.

It also discourages people from interacting with their system using their honest opinion, since that gives less points than if they ranked based on the presumed \\\"mean opinion\\\".\\nIn this first draft I built a system to rate users in the three domains \\\"voting\\\", \\\"prompting\\\" and \\\"ranking\\\", each of which with their own individual point storages (for a total score we can weight and merge those).\\n\\nFurther, we also tally how many \\\"good questions\\\" a user submitted (with \\\"good\\\" meaning \\\"above average\\\"): This can be used to prevent spam on the leaderboards (and in the system) as we can simply filter out people below a certain quality threshold (e.g. \\\"if you have contributed at least 20 times, and your score is above 80%, we show your contributions on the leaderboard and may include them in our dataset\\\").\\n\\nTo do this we need to (at some point) retire a question from being shown to users, since only then can we use the consensus mechanisms to reward users (since otherwise the consensus might still change).\\n\\nI envision a workflow like this:\\n\\nuse the maximum information gain metric to sample from the questions\\nto create a pseudo-thompson sampling scheme over all questions\\nOnce a question reaches either a threshhold number of votes, or falls below a minimum information gain (i.e. continuing to vote isn't expected to do a lot), we can retire the question into a \\\"passive pool\\\" of finished questions\\nWhen we move a question from the \\\"active pool\\\" of questions into the \\\"passive pool\\\" of finished questions, we compute the consensus, and reward the people that took part in answering the question\\n@MattAlexMiracle\\nCollaborator\\nMattAlexMiracle commented 2 weeks ago\\nLGTM, thank you\\nif I understand correctly, a \\\"vote\\\" is a best-one-of-N judgement. Is there also a variant if each user provides a complete ranking of all N choices? I'm thinking if we already make the user read all of the options, they might as well rank all of them.\\n\\n@yk moving your question over from the closed issue.\\nat the moment I consider three scoring systems:\\n\\nbest-of-N (how good was the vote)\\nprompt value (i.e. the dual to best-of-N: how good was the question)\\nranking (i.e. given K options to rank producing a ranking how well does a users rank line up with the consensus rank)\\nthe latter seems to be what you are getting at. This is currently done by obtaining N rankings (which might be partial), and merging them using the ranked pairs algorithm, giving a consensus rank \\u03c4'. I then compute the Kendall-tau correlation and shift it such that instead of being in [-1,1] it is in [0,1], which then gives you your ranking points.\\nI consider a ranking \\\"good\\\" if it has a correlation of at least 0.5\\n\\nyk reacted with thumbs up emoji\\n@TMRolle\\nTMRolle commented last week\\nJust a thought, could this be greatly simplified by using an existing text dataset to source the responses, and work backwards to manually or semi-automatically human generate the prompts to match?\\n\\nI.e. take the existing text of a wikipedia page for the Artic Monkeys, and then just have a human back-write a prompt like \\\"Write a wikipedia-style page about the English rock band \\\"The Arctic Monkeys\\\"\\\".\\n\\nIt seems like an approach like this would significantly simplify the process while still maintaining a high level of control over dataset content balance and response quality. Large swaths of the training data could likely be generated from semi-structured/rich metadata content fairly easily as well, such as by using the Wikidata and Wikipedia datasets along with a few templates variations of \\\"Write a wikipedia-style page about the musician [musician name]. Be sure to include details about [items found in structured table of contents].\\\"\\n\\nYou probably would want to limit the amount of template based generated data, but it could be useful for bootstrapping an initial training set, and could potentially approach human generated prompt quality by using a much less sophisticated LLM to generate paraphrasings of the template prompts.\\n\\nThe use of fixed high quality response data would also lend itself to a natural gamification approach for human generated prompts, where users could propose prompts for a given response in a Jeapordy-style game, and proposed prompts could be ranked by other users and points awarded through a simple reddit-style upvote/downvote points system.\\n\\n@yk\\nCollaborator\\nyk commented last week\\n@TMRolle fully agree, and we're heavily thinking about (and some people already working on) prompt-based data. The problem is that it quickly leads to overfitting. The impressive thing about something like ChatGPT is how versatile it is, i.e. how many different tasks it can do, even beyond what its creators had intended. If we go the template way, then the training dataset will consist of lots of samples from relatively few tasks and therefore the danger is that the model becomes too task-specific, so you're definitely correct in pointing out that the amount of data generated like this has to be carefully balanced, and in my estimation the optimal balance of it might be quite low. Which is a bummer, given how easy it would be to produce.\\n\\n@TMRolle\\nTMRolle commented last week \\u2022 \\nMakes sense on the structured data+template approach - though I think it would still likely be a good approach to even fully human generated instruction prompts, given it's much faster and easier for humans to look at a desired output and come up with a corresponding input prompt than it is to start from scratch and write both the prompt and response, and since that could presumably be done with any arbitrary excerpts from an existing language model training dataset.\\n\\n@andreaskoepf\\nCollaborator\\nAuthor\\nandreaskoepf commented 4 days ago\\nSeveral ideas have been discussed during the last days. I will summarize a simple system that I propose to implement.\\n\\nThere are two related scoring systems that have different requirements:\\na) gamification reward for the user (leaderbaord) to incentivize high quality feedback & peer-review/moderation\\nb) ranked completions of a given prompt for the RM dataset or to evaluate/compare a trained model\\n\\nFor gamification we want timely feedback and a monotonously increasing score. Negative rewards should only be assigned to users when we know with high certainty that they deliberately misbehaved, e.g. submitted inappropriate prompts or spam. Ratings and rankings by (random) other users provide a strong basis for judging user input.\\n\\nRankings exported from the DB are less time critical but should be as accurate as possible.\\n\\nSteps to collect and rank replies for a give prompt (generation of initial prompts has to be disussed separately):\\n\\nMessageTree growinng phase: A new message tree is created with an initial prompt. We assume this prompt has already been screened and passed baisc quality tests (not described here). The system selects sets a goal for the number of total descendants to collect in the tree. The system hands out text-reply tasks to users with randomly sampled nodes of the tree as conversation-thread (traced to root). To create wider and less deep trees nodes could be sampled inverse-proportional to depth. The colleection phase creates a random conversation tree and ends when the desired number of total messages in the tree has been reached.\\n\\nQuality feedback/Rating phase: During the tree growing phase as soon as new messages have been sent to the backend they can be handed out to random users (different from the author) for quality-feedback. For this feedback a user generated completion is shown with the conversation context and the user is asked to check a couple of quality features, maybe also to assign multiple attributes to it. Quality feedback is used to auto-delete/exclude messages from the tree which also influences when the tree is ready to be declared as mature and ready for the ranking phase.\\n\\nOnce the desired number of messages passing the qa-feedback step have been collected the random tree can go into ranking mode. No new messages are accepted and the messages of all nodes with two or more direct replies can be handed out to users for ranking.\\n\\nDuring ranking we we can assign reward to the orignal text-authors depending on individual ranking results, e.g. 3 points for the 1st place, 2 points for the 2nd, 1 points for the 3rd an 0 for others (or eponentially decaying, for example1st: 9, 2nd:3, 3rd:1).\\n\\n(to be continued)\\n\\n@andreaskoepf andreaskoepf mentioned this issue 4 days ago\\nCreate a separate task type for collecting text labels #344\\n Closed\\n@MattAlexMiracle\\nCollaborator\\nMattAlexMiracle commented 3 days ago\\nI have a system for task-selection over at #383.\\nThis method gives a self-adjusting distribution over whether to do \\\"rating\\\", \\\"prompting\\\", \\\"answering\\\" or \\\"ranking\\\".\\n\\nThere's already a system for selecting which question to select for voting, this one now also adds in a system for which prompt to produce answers to.\\nLast thing will be which thing to rate next.\\n\\n@danielpatrickhug danielpatrickhug mentioned this issue 2 days ago\\nAdd message tree state model #414\\n Merged\\n@hemangjoshi37a\\n\\n \\nAdd heading textAdd bold text, <Ctrl+b>Add italic text, <Ctrl+i>\\nAdd a quote, <Ctrl+Shift+.>Add code, <Ctrl+e>Add a link, <Ctrl+k>\\nAdd a bulleted list, <Ctrl+Shift+8>Add a numbered list, <Ctrl+Shift+7>Add a task list, <Ctrl+Shift+l>\\nDirectly mention a user or team\\nReference an issue, pull request, or discussion\\nAdd saved reply\\nLeave a comment\\nNo file chosen\\nAttach files by dragging & dropping, selecting or pasting them.\\nStyling with Markdown is supported\\nRemember, contributions to this repository should follow its contributing guidelines.\\nAssignees\\n@MattAlexMiracle\\nMattAlexMiracle\\nLabels\\nbackend\\nresearch\\nProjects\\n Open-Assistant\\n\\nStatus: hammer_and_wrench Todo\\nMilestone\\nNo milestone\\nDevelopment\\nNo branches or pull requests\\n\\nNotifications\\nCustomize\\nYou\\u2019re not receiving notifications from this thread.\\n4 participants\\n@yk\\n@TMRolle\\n@andreaskoepf\\n@MattAlexMiracle\\nFooter\\n\\u00a9 2023 GitHub, Inc.\\nFooter navigation\\nTerms\\nPrivacy\\nSecurity\\nStatus\\nDocs\\nContact GitHub\\nPricing\\nAPI\\nTraining\\nBlog\\nAbout\\nScoring-algorithm for crowd-sourced data collection \\u00b7 Issue #37 \\u00b7 LAION-AI/Open-Assistant``` Here is a issue from the same project.\",\n        \"response\": \"This code defines the Message model, which represents a message in a conversation.

This would allow you to handle the error more gracefully without raising an exception.You could consider defining a message_payload property that returns the payload.payload field, and use this property in the text property instead of accessing the payload.payload.text field directly. This would make the code more readable and easier to maintain.You could consider using a ForeignKeyConstraint to define the foreign key relationship between the parent_id field and the id field, rather than relying on the nullable argument.

This would allow you to define the set of acceptable values for this field as a named enumeration, rather than a string with a regular expression validation.Instead of raising an exception when the payload field is not a MessagePayload instance, you could consider using an if statement to check the type and return an appropriate value or response. This would allow you to handle the error more gracefully without raising an exception.You could consider defining a message_payload property that returns the payload.payload field, and use this property in the text property instead of accessing the payload.payload.text field directly. This would make the code more readable and easier to maintain.You could consider using a ForeignKeyConstraint to define the foreign key relationship between the parent_id field and the id field, rather than relying on the nullable argument.

This would reduce duplication and make the code easier to maintain.Instead of manually concatenating strings to create the message, you could use a template engine like Jinja to define the message templates and fill in the placeholders with the relevant task data. This would make the code more organized and easier to read.Instead of using a long series of if statements to determine the type of task and which message to return, you could create a dictionary that maps task types to message templates and use the task.type field to look up the appropriate message template. This would make the code more flexible and easier to add new types of tasks.You could consider moving the functions that define the reusable 'components' of the messages (e.g. _h1, _h2, etc.) to a separate module, as they are not directly related to the task data and could be reused in other contexts.Here is an example of how the initial_prompt_message function could be rewritten using these
